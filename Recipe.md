Steps for filter coffee recipe with filter:-

Step1:- Let’s start with the decoction process first take the filter and clean it properly then on the upper half put the coffee powder and then press it with very little pressure with the plunger with a handle for 2 times. Don’t press it too hard we don’t want to make it as a brick.

Step2:- place the upper part of the filter on the lower body of the filter, boil the water and then pour it in that upper part fill the upper compartment, and cover it with the filter lid, keep it at about 5 to 6 hours to percolate the coffee. 

without filter:- If you don’t have a filter then you can use a strainer with a muslin cloth and then same put coffee powder and place the strainer in a big bowl and pour the water in 3 batches and keep aside.

Step3:- boil milk and put it in a glass and then pour that filtered coffee in both glasses keep little coffee aside for the last pour.

Step4:- then take a cup and pour it in and then again in glass do this process spontaneously and you’ll get a froth on top then stop it and pour that leftover coffee in it. Your filter coffee is ready.

Serving:- For better experience serve it in metallic dabaras in a south Indian style filter coffee with some cookies I like to have it with chocolate cookies especially love it with chocolate-flavored Oreos. And also You Can Try Dalgona Recipe For your Evening Breakfast.
